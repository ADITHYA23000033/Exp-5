# NAME: ADITHYA V
# REGISTER NUMBER: 212223110001

# AIM:
To study the problem statement ,SRS document and draw the UML diagram of student enrollment system .



# SRS (Procedure):
Analyze the Student Registration System and identify its key actors (e.g., Student, Admin, Faculty) and system functionalities (e.g., Register Course, Add Student, Generate Report Card).

Create the Use Case Diagram to show actors and their interactions with the system.

Develop the Class Diagram representing classes, attributes, operations, and relationships.

Design the Activity Diagram describing workflows such as course registration.

Construct the Sequence Diagram illustrating interactions between objects during processes like student enrollment.

Prepare the Communication Diagram showing collaboration among objects.

Organize components into packages using a Package Diagram for modularity.
